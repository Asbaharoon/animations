<h1 align="center">Java Animations</h1>

<h4 align="center">This repository will no longer be updated (If it is, then only the addition of new animations, etc.) due to the fact that I do not see the point in continuing it. I see the complete stiffness of everything in it, and therefore I think it would be better to just inform about it.</h4>

<h4 align="center">I really wanted to continue this project, but now it is abandoned, I don't really see interest in its improvements, I believe that those who need it will easily improve it, but at the moment - this is the best repository for this part.</h4>
<h4 align="center">Thanks to those who supported the project with stars/forks. It was fun to support mine project. U r welcome there if it is required.</h4>
<h4 align="center">By the way, I threw tests, if you need an explanation - they will come to your aid. If the information you need is not there, then open the classes, there is a description for almost all methods, what they return, etc.</h4>
<h3 align="center">Thanks for reading.</h3>
